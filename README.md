## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ˜Ž About me: I am in the final year of studying integrated masters in Computer Science in the University Of St Andrews.
ðŸš€ðŸ“² Iâ€™m currently working on developing an IOS app with a companion WatchOS app to do Automatic Activity Recognition that enables continual activity recognition. That is, not only perform activity inference on the current sensor data, but also continuously extend the model with new activities.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift and SwiftUI.
